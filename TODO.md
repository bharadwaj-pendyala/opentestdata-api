# TODO

## Big picture

The idea is pretty simple.  Build a database online that is open to people uploading and downloading test data.  For example, test addresses that can be entered into an address field on a web site.  examples of test addresses:
* 1600 Pensylvania Ave
* One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA
* Bad Address
* Empty string

Today test teams spend a lot of time designing test suites from scratch with data like addresses, names, etc.  It would be far better if there was a shared database of all this data so testers can just download it to use in their manual and automated tests.  Regarding addresses for example...it would be far best if a random app tester didn't make up her own address test cases, but rather got them from a list uploaded by someone at FedEx or UPS that knows all the valid, dangerous, long, invalid, etc. addresses.

Basic requirements in my mind are:
* Ability to upload data via REST API and Web UI
* Ability to download data via REST API and WEB UI
* User accounts required for all upload download
* All data should be tagged, e..g 'positive test', 'negative test', '<scenario name>', etc.
* All data should be searchable and explorable (via tags) visually and via APIs
* System to give points / badges for users that upload valuable data (e.g. others download it and/or up vote it's usefulness)
* Ability to show a profile pic for a given user with their badge
* Ability to flag data for moderation and a quick moderation us for 'admin accounts'. In case someones personal or innappropriate data is uploaded.
